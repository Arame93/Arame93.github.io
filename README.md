# My Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio! Here you will find a collection of my work showcasing my skills in data analysis, and science. Each project reflects my commitment to solving problems with efficient and scalable solutions.

## üî≠ Projects

Here are some of my key projects:

- [Bank Telemarketing Campaign Analysis and Prediction](https://arame93appio-9uibnvkleiafqfezc2hvca.streamlit.app/): The goal of this case study is to do end to end EDA of the bank telemarketing campaign data to infer knowledge that where bank has to put more effort to improve it's positive response rate. In addition, build a prediction model for the bank to identify in the future the customers who will likely accept or reject the marketing offer. I built a data preprocessing pipeline and a Random Forest Classifier with the best parameters gotten from a GridSearchCV method. The model accuracy is 89%. Then I created a simple Streamlit app to deployed the model. 
- [Jio Prepaid Plan Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Arame93/Arame93.github.io/blob/0ed405d10720f20eb98337e4065d7f8024a97f94/Prepaid_plans_recommendations/Jio%20Prepaid%20Planes%20Project.ipynb): The goal of this Jio prepaid plans case study is to analyze and optimize pricing strategies to maximize profit while ensuring customer satisfaction. I explore the dataset, perform customer segmentation, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations for pricing and marketing strategies. I did a T-test which reveals that there the price affects the company revenue and also the customer retention. I also did a KMeans clustering method to segment customer based on their prepraid plan preferences. In addition, I have performed a logistic regression model to predict how a foreseen customer will behave according to the company offer. At the end an optimization and sensitivy analysis were done to provide optimal plans recommendation suitable both the company and the customers.
- [Vegan Recipe Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arame/viz/VeganRecipesDashboard/Tableaudebord1): in this project, I used NLP techniques to extract nutrient contents for instance amount of sodium in grammes, sugar, fat etc from the variable recipe composition which contents only texts. Then I created for each nutrient a variable that contents the numerical quantity value. The goal of this preprocessing was to transform the data in such a way that I can build a meaningful analysis on vegan recipes quality in nutrient contents such protein, sugar, fat etc. The key outputs of this analysis is then presented throught this tableau dashboard.
